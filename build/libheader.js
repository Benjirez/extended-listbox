/**
 * Extended-Listbox is a simple jQuery plugin that provides a more powerful
 * alternative to the standard `<select>` tag.
 *
 * The main problem of <select> tag is that last one isn't flexible
 * for customization with *CSS*. Extended-Listbox solves this problem.
 * This component creates a list structure based on <div> tags.
 * The configuration is completely in JavaScript. It opens up great
 * possibilities for customization.
